For this assignment, I decided to create a connect 4 terminal game in c++. I constructed the user interface in ncurses and used a window to display the board. It will tell you whose turn it currently is, as well as tell you when you win. The game is played by pressing a number on the keyboard. The number 1 corresponds with the far left column and 2 is the second from left column and so on. Upon finishing the game, you will be asked if you would like to play again.

As far as the logic of the game, you need to have a game loop where the majority of the game is actaully played. You also need to check the user's move to see if they pressed a valid key and if the column is currently full or not, and check if that move won the player the game.

I also decided to add the ability to undo a move which is done with the key 'u'. This updates the board and redraws it as if that move had never happened
