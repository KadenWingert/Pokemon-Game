This week, the changes that were implementing ncurses which included initializing the terminal, using ncurses instead of usleep(), and 
implementing the color feature in the ncurses library. We also added the feature of moving the pc and displaying a list of all the trainers
on the board. I also added the features of initaiting a battle when a pc attempts to move into the cell of an npc or vice versa. When 
on the cell of a pokecenter or pokemeart, you can hit the > key to enter it and be taken to a different screen.
