This week, the changes that were made involve placing npc characters on the board and having
them move around. Each character has its own pattern of movements that it will follow. The movement
occurs through generating a new map each time the character "moves" and since the map is generated
so quickly, it appears as though it is moving in real time. The order of movements is processed
through a priority queue.
