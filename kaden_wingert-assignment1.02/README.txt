This Program uses several functions to create allow the player to naviage to different boards on the
map. The world is a 401x401 grid and the user can move north,south,east,west, or fly to any coordinate.
The paths to neighoring boards connect and the outside boards do not have a path.

Another feature added this week, was the probabilty factor in pokecenter/mart spawns. As you go further
away from (0,0), the probability of encountering these buildings decreases
