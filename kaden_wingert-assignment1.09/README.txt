This week, the biggest thing that we implemented was the battle feature. When battleing a wild pokemone, you have the option to open your
bag, fight, run, or switch to use a different pokemon. When you defeat a wild pokemon, you then have the choice to catch it by using a pokeball. The is the same when you are battling a trainer pokemon except you don't ahve the option to run, and you can't caputre the trainer's pokemon upon defeat.

We also added the ability of pokecenters to allow you to stock up on revives which heal dead pokemon, potions, which heal injured pokemon,
and pokeballs which are used to caputer pokemon. 

You are not allowed to fight if all of your pokemon are injured.
