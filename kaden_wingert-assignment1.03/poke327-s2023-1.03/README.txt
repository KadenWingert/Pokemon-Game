This Program uses several functions to print the distance % 100 from every spot on the map to the PC.
A map is printed for the paths from a hiker character and a rival charcater. If the the character is
unable to reach the pc from a certain position, then 2 blank spaces will be output instead of a
number. This method uses dijkstra's algorithim to find the shortest path from each position on the map.
