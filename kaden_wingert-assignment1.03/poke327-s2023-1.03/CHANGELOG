2/11/2023 2:30 (pm)	Randomly generated a PC character on the board in a function called 
				placePC(map_t *m). This also stores the PC position on the board in a pc 
				struct
2/11/2023 7:10 (pm)	Used a copy of the Dijkstra's algo that was given but made some modifications.
				It now is able to print the path to the PC, but I didn't add the feature of 
				blank spaces if you can't reach the pc from that position.
